# php-task-2
first pull

then start up your environment(wamp zamp etc)

start from the register page
localhost:whatever/register.php

(on mine it's localhost:8888/startngphp/login.php due to the name of my folder) 

go crazy with this page then test out the rest.

there is a link to my dashboard on the index page if the user is actually logged in 
if not this link wont show.

the index page really just gives you notifications dont expect much there..
